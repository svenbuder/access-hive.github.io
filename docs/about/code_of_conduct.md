ACCESS-Hive is an open community supported effort. For it to be successful it must be a welcoming and inclusive space so that everyone in the community feels able to contribute. 

To ensure this is the case users and contributors to ACCESS-Hive and the ACCESS-Hive Forum are required to abide by the [ACCESS-NRI code of conduct][code-of-conduct].
