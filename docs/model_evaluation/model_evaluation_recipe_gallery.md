# Model Evaluation and Diagnostics (MED) Recipe Gallery

{% include "call_contribute.md" %}

While we are still building this gallery, please have a look at the Community MED Recipes listed at <a href="../community_resources/community_med_recipes.md">Community Resources -> Community Model Evaluation Recipes</a> {{ community}}

Here, we plan to provide you with an embedded link to our actively maintained Model Evaluation and Dianostics (MED) Recipe Gallery, hosted at [medportal.herokuapp.com](https://medportal.herokuapp.com/models/published). For now, we provide a placeholder image with link and pointers to useful Model Evaluation and Dianostics (MED) resources.
