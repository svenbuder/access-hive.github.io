The ACCESS-AM model is a coupled model between the atmosphere and the land. The atmospheric model component is the [UM model][UM-hive]. The UM model comes by default coupled to the [JULES][JULES-hive] land model. That is why the first configurations and experiments released of ACCESS-AM will be UM-JULES configurations. But the ACCESS-NRI is working to ensure subsequent releases of ACCESS-AM use the [CABLE][CABLE-hive] land model instead.

### Getting started information

[On this page][UMstart], you will find information on how to gain access to the UM model and start using the model. You will also find links to various configurations and experiments you can use as a basis to design your experiment.

### Configurations


### Experiments

Some experiments already run with the UM are listed on:
