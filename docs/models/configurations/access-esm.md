ACCESS-ESM stands for ACCESS **E**arth **S**ystem **M**odel. Earth system model means it is a fully-coupled model that includes carbon cycle components.

ACCESS-NRI will release an ACCESS-ESM model configuration. The first release of ACCESS-ESM will be derived from the [CSIRO ACCESS-ESM1.5 configuration](#access-esm15) and will include [atmosphere], [land] and [land biogeochemistry], [ocean] and [ocean biogeochemistry], and [sea ice] components.

ACCESS-ESM1.5 [@Ziehn2020-fq] is a fully-coupled climate model with land and ocean carbon cycle components. ACCESS-ESM1.5 has mainly been developed to enable Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. An assessment of the climate response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.87Â°C.
