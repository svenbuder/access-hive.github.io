ACCESS-S is the Bureau of Meteorology's climate modelling system used for seasonal forecasting.

This coupled model uses a different set of model components than the other ACCESS models:

- [UM][UM] for the atmosphere
- [JULES][JULES] for the land
- [NEMO][NEMO] for the ocean
- [CICE][CICE] for the sea-ice
- [OASIS3-MCT][OASIS3-MCT] for the coupler
