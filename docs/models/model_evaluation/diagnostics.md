The Afterburner project is a multi-year initiative of the UK Met Office to develop a suite of robust, reusable scientific software tools and applications which can be integrated into climate model runs to deliver commonly needed in-line (as a model is running) and post-processing functionality. The project is funded by the UK government through a combination of direct grant and the â€‹[Newton Fund](http://www.newtonfund.ac.uk).
