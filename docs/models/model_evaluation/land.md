Climpred aims to offer a comprehensive set of analysis tools for assessing the quality of dynamical forecasts relative to verification products (e.g., observations, reanalysis products, control simulations). Climpred supports a broad range of temporal scales of prediction, spanning the weather, subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S), and seasonal-to-decadal (S2D) communities.
