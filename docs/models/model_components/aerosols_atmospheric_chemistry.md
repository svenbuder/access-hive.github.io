[The UK Chemistry-Aerosol model (UKCA)][ukca-wiki] is a community atmospheric chemistry-aerosol global model suitable for a range of topics in climate and environmental change research developed in the United Kingdom.

### How is UKCA used?
UKCA chemistry model is turned on in ACCESS-CM2-Chem.

## <div class="center-icons"> [GLOMAP][glomap-wiki] {{ supported }} </div>

UKCA contains an aerosol scheme that can be used independently, the GLObal Model of Aerosol Processes [(GLOMAP)][glomap-wiki]. The multi-component multi-modal GLOMAP model allows simulation of aerosol number, size, and concentrations of individual components such as sulphate, different types of carbon, and sea salt.

### How is GLOMAP used?
GLOMAP is used in ACCESS-CM2 and ACCESS-CM2-Chem.
