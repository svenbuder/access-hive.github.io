## <div class="center-icons"> [CABLE][cable-wiki] {{ supported }} </div>

The Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE) is a land-surface model that simulates energy, water and carbon flows between the land surface and the atmosphere. This component has been developed by Australian researchers across the national climate science community. 

### How is CABLE used?

CABLE can be run as a standalone model, for a single location, a region or globally. The model is coupled to the Met Office Unified Model (UM) and provides the land surface component of the Earth System Models ACCESS-ESM1-5 and ACCESS-CM2.

CABLE is an open source model. [Registration][cable-wiki] is required to access the CABLE code repository.

## <div class="center-icons"> [JULES][jules-web] {{ supported }} </div>

The Joint UK Land Environment System (JULES) is a land surface model that has evolved from the Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme (MOSES).

JULES has been packaged into a community land surface model that can be used offline, but is also the new land surface model of the UK Met Office Unified Model. Some of the ACCESS models used for weather simulations use JULES instead of CABLE. 

### How is JULES used?

The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) uses the JULES land surface scheme in its numerical weather prediction models such as ACCESS S (Seasonal) and C (City).
