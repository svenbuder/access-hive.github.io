CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach)-CNP (Carbon-Nitrogen-Phosphorous) is the land biogeochemistry model developed in CABLE.

CASA-CNP models the dynamics of carbon pools and nitrogen and phosphorous limitations. It is directly coupled with the CABLE land surface model.

### How is CASA-CNP used?

CASA-CNP is switched on for carbon-cycle to use in the ACCESS-ESM1.5 model.
