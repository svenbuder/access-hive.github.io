## <div class="center-icons"> WOMBAT {{ supported }} </div>
WOMBAT is the ocean carbon model (World Ocean Model of Biogeochemistry And Trophic-dynamics), developed in Australia. It calculates the carbon fluxes of the ocean, by simulating the evolution of phosphate, oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity and iron with one class of phytoplankton and zooplankton.

WOMBAT is a Nutrient, Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Detritus (NPZD) model, with one zooplankton and one phytoplankton class.

### How is WOMBAT used?

WOMBAT is [coupled to the MOM5 ocean model][MOM5-WOMBAT-code] in the ACCESS-ESM1.5 and ACCESS-OM2 models.
